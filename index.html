	<p>I am not a big fan of html, nor css - webdesign might as well be the worst thing that has ever happened to me, but alas</p>

	<h3> Things I enjoy: </h3>
	<ul>
		<li>Good Turkish coffee</li>
		<li>Eastern cooking</li>
		<li>Target shooting</li>
		<li>Using obscure or less popular programming languages for ultimately useless projects but ones I enjoy greatly</li>
		<li>Tinkering with old tech and restoration of vintage computers and consoles</li>
		<li>Denying said tech the privilage of death and making it do things it was never meant to do - such as running modern Gentoo on a 2001 PowerBook G4</li>
	</ul>
